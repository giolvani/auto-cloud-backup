```

### Scheduling with cron

To schedule daily backups, add a cron entry:

0 2 * * * cd /path/to/AutoCloudBackup && python scripts/run_backup.py
```

### Configuring settings.json

The configuration file `settings.json` is used to define the databases, repositories, and storage details. Below is a sample configuration:

```json
{
    "databases": [
        {
            "name": "your_database",
            "user": "your_db_user",
            "password": "your_password",
            "host": "your_db_host",
            "port": "your_db_port",
            "type": "mysql",  // Use "postgres" for PostgreSQL
            "ssh": {
                "host": "optional_ssh_host",
                "user": "optional_ssh_user",
                "port": "optional_ssh_port",
                "identity_file": "path/to/your/ssh_key.pem"
            }
        }
    ],
    "repos": [
        {
            "profile": "GitProfileName",
            "repositories": [
                "git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepo1.git",
                "git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepo2.git"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "storage": {
        "type": "remote", // Use "local" for local storage. If "local", you don't need to set the next fields.
        "bucket_name": "your_bucket_name",
        "region": "nyc3",
        "endpoint_url": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com",
        "access_key": "your_access_key",
        "secret_key": "your_secret_key"
    }
}
```

- databases: List your databases with their access credentials.
- repos: List the Git repositories you wish to back up.
- storage: Configure your cloud storage provider for backups, or local storage if desired.

### Storage Configuration

The application supports both local and remote storage configurations for backups. If the `storage.type` in your configuration is set to `"local"`, the backup files will be saved locally and will not be deleted after the backup process. This allows you to retain local copies of your database dumps for additional security or manual access.

## Security Considerations

To avoid exposing your credentials:
- Use `.pgpass` for PostgreSQL or `.my.cnf` for MySQL to store your credentials when possible.
- Ensure file permissions are properly set for any sensitive files.
